* An app to receive CGM data such as: [xDrip](http://stephenblackwasalreadytaken.github.io/xDrip/), [xDrip+]https://github.com/jamorham/xDrip-plus>), [Glimp](http://www.nightscout.info/wiki/welcome/nightscout-for-libre),  [600SeriesAndroidUploader](https://github.com/pazaan/600SeriesAndroidUploader)
